## Project Proposal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cosaic is a social networking application that allows users to share their daily lives through online image posts. When users login to Cosaic, they will be able to view their previous posts on their own profile page as well as update their status, post pictures, and add captions and hashtags. Additionally, Cosaic will allow users to connect with other users by searching for their profile name and viewing their posts. Cosaic is designed to be a fun, casual platform that allows users to share their story with the world and view the stories of others. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stakeholders of this project will include the members of the project team (Ahmed Darkazanli, Albert Ong, and Chloe Phan), project manager (Professor Mike Wu), and every user who loves to share their interests and activities and regularly follow their favorite people. The individuals who most enjoy interacting through social media will be the end-users that our application is targeted at. Therefore, our team must ensure that our software is functional, secure, and bug-free in order to provide the best user experience and maintain a positive image of the people working on the project.
